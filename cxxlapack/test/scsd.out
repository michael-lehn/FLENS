 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   10.00


 CSD routines passed the tests of the error exits (  0 tests done)

 All tests for CSD routines passed the threshold (   270 tests run)
