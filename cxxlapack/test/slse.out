 Tests of the Linear Least Squares routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.0

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         6     0     5     8    10    30
    P:         0     5     5     5     8    20
    N:         5     5     6     8    12    40

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 LSE routines passed the tests of the error exits (  8 tests done)

 All tests for LSE routines passed the threshold (    96 tests run)
