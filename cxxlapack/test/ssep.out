 Tests of the Symmetric Eigenvalue Problem routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.0

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     1     2     3     5    20
    N:         0     1     2     3     5    20
    NB:        1     3     3     3    10
    NBMIN:     2     2     2     2     2
    NX:        1     0     5     9     1

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   50.00
