 Tests of the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition routines

 LAPACK VERSION 3.3.0

 The following parameter values will be used:
    M:         0     5     9    10    20    12    12    40
    P:         4     0    12    14    10    10    20    15
    N:         3    10    15    12     8    20     8    20

 Relative machine underflow is taken to be    0.117549E-37
 Relative machine overflow  is taken to be    0.340282E+39
 Relative machine precision is taken to be    0.596046E-07

 Routines pass computational tests if test ratio is less than   20.00


 GSV routines passed the tests of the error exits ( 33 tests done)

 All tests for GSV routines passed the threshold (   384 tests run)
