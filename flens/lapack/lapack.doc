============

At the moment we are working on a C++ port of __LAPACK__.  *Sound tedious?  It
is a joy with FLENS*!  This is because FLENS gives you easy-to-use tools for
implementing efficient, robust and reliable numerical software.

Not all LAPACK function have been ported so far.  However, if you have an
external LAPACK implementation on your system then you can use FLENS-LAPACK
as a high-level interface.  FLENS-LAPACK accesses the external LAPACK library
through the low-level CXXLAPACK layer.  The usage and concept of this high-level
(CXX)LAPACK interface is illustrated in the __tutorial__.

Generic FLENS-LAPACK: Purpose
=============================
FLENS is a comfortable tool for the implementation of numerical algorithms.  At
the same time we avoid negative impacts on efficiency due to abstraction.  But
only claiming that we can achieve this two goals is one thing.  The other thing
is proving this!  In this respect you could regard the FLENS-LAPACK as a
prove of our claims.  So our FLENS-LAPACK port demonstrates the following
features:

  - *Easy to read and understand*

    There are many C++ libraries that implement LAPACK functionality.  But when
    you look at their code it is often hard to even recognize the underlying
    algorithm.  It is like the algorithm gets lost in all these C++ template
    tricks and tweaks.

    The Fortan implementation of LAPACK is much easier to read and understand
    than all these C++ implementations.  Even if you are not very familiar with
    Fortran!  So even if some C++ nerds don't like to hear it Fortran LAPACK
    is great.  However, there is one drawback.  As there are no actual
    matrix/vector types many parameters have to be passed to LAPACK routines.
    This is sometime error-prone and hard to read.  But still better than
    many other C++ implementations.

    The FLENS-LAPACK not only competes in terms of readability with the FORTRAN
    implementation but even exceeds it.  FLENS provides a very expressive
    notation for numerical linear algebra.  Therefore FLENS-LAPACK
    implementation of numerical algorithms is *really readable*.  You can
    consider FLENS-LAPACK as an improved reimplementation of Fortran LAPACK.

  - *Same results as the Fortran Implementation of LAPACK*

    LAPACK is the king in the numerical software field,established and well
    tested.  Our implementation is intended to produce exactly the same results
    as the Fortran LAPACK (Version 3.3.1).  As long as the same BLAS
    implementation gets used.  And with *exactly the same results* we mean that
    we even produce the same roundoff errors.

  - *Same performance as the Fortran implementation of LAPACK*

    While we have not begun with benchmarking we are confident that in the
    end we achieve the same performance as the Fortran LAPACK.  Again under
    the assumption that in both cases the same BLAS implementation is used.

  - *CXXBLAS*

    We provide a generic BLAS implementation that gets called if no native
    BLAS implementation like __ATLAS__, __GotoBLAS__ or __OpenBLAS__ is
    available or if the involved data types are not supported.

    While CXXBLAS currently passes all BLAS test we plan to modify its
    implementation such that it produces exactly the same results as
    the BLAS reference implementation.

    Due to CXXBLAS the FLENS-LAPACK routines can be used with data types from
    C++ multi-precision libraries.

Current Status
==============
In the following we give an overview of the functionality currently provided by
FLENS-LAPACK.  Function names of FLENS-LAPACK are derived from corresponding
LAPACK.  We removed letters from the function names that merely specify the
argument types:

- __sv__ in FLENS-LAPACK corresponds to __dgesv__ and __zgesv__ in LAPACK
- __trs__ in FLENS-LAPACK corresponds to __dgetrs__, __zgetrs__, __dtrtrs__ and
  __ztrtrs__ in LAPACK
- ...

At the moment some generic function of FLENS-LAPACK do not support complex
element types.  However, this functionality is available through an external
LAPACK library.

Have a look into the __tutorial__ for learning how to use an external LAPACK
implementation.  By default FLENS-LAPACK will prefer a generic LAPACK
implementation over a external implementation.  An external implementation only
gets called if no generic implementation is available.  You can change this
default behavior through macros as described in the tutorial.

 | FLENS     |  DESCRIPTION                                      | LAPACK     |
 +===========+===================================================+============+
 | __ev__    | Computes the eigenvalues and left and right       | __dgeev__  |
 |           | eigenvectors of a general matrix.                 |            |
 |           |                                                   |            |
 |           | *Example:*  __lapack-geev__.                      |            |
 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+------------+
 | __evx__   | Computes the eigenvalues and left and right       | __dgeevx__ |
 |           | eigenvectors of a general matrix.  Optionally     |            |
 |           | also, it computes a balancing transformation to   |            |
 |           | improve the conditioning of the eigenvalues and   |            |
 |           | eigenvectors, reciprocal condition numbers        |            |
 |           | for the eigenvalues, and reciprocal condition     |            |
 |           | numbers for the right eigenvectors.               |            |
 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+------------+
 | __es__    | Computes for a general matrix, the eigenvalues,   | __dgees__  |
 |           | the real Schur form $T$, and, optionally, the     |            |
 |           | matrix of Schur vectors $Z$.  This gives the      |            |
 |           | Schur factorization $A = Z T Z^T.$                |            |
 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+------------+
 | __esx__   | Like __es__ but optionally, it also orders the    | __dgeesx__ |
 |           | eigenvalues on the diagonal of the  real Schur    |            |
 |           | form so that selected eigenvalues are at the top  |            |
 |           | left; computes a reciprocal condition number for  |            |
 |           | the average of the selected eigenvalues;          |            |
 |           | and computes a reciprocal condition number for    |            |
 |           | the right invariant subspace corresponding to the |            |
 |           | selected eigenvalues.  The leading columns of $Z$ |            |
 |           | form an orthonormal basis for this invariant      |            |
 |           | subspace.                                         |            |
 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+------------+
 | __hrd__   | Reduces a general matrix to upper Hessenberg form | __dgehrd__ |
 |           | by an orthogonal similarity transformation.       |            |
 +-----------+---------------------------------------------------+------------+
 | __orghr__ | Generates the orthogonal transformation matrix    | __dorghr__ |
 |           | from a reduction to Hessenberg form.              |            |

Todo
====

Of course there many more TODOs.  But theses are the most important:

- Change CXXBLAS such that it produces exactly the same results as __RefBLAS__
- Operator overloading works for most things but needs still needs some work
  and checking.  At the moment we call most of the time the FLENS-BLAS functions
  directly.  Actually that is not that cumbersome.  But once we have overloaded
  operators back we can the FLENS-LAPACK implementation further!

Related Projects
================

- __LAPACK__ itself of course.
- __mpack__ which is also a generic C++ port of LAPACK.  To our knowledge the
  following strategy gets used for porting LAPACK:
     - __f2c__ is used to create a C implementation of LAPACK
     - Various scripts (the magic ingredient) are used to create a generic C++
       implementation from the C code.
  This approach has both, advantages and (depending on your own goals)
  disadvantages:
     - *Pros:*  You have a complete generic C++ port of LAPACK that supports
       various multiple precision arithmetic libraries like __GMP__, __MPFR__
       and __QD__.
     - *Cons:*  The automatic generated code is hard to read (as is typical for
       f2c-generated code).
